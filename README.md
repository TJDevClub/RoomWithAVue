# Room with a Vue
Vue.js is a view library that helps you tie together the DOM and your data. It's
very lightweight and performant, and has gained lot so popularity since its
release for its low barrier to entry and similarities to React.

## Installation and Setup
There are a couple of ways to use Vue.js.

Read all about them in detail
[here](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html)

1. Use the CDN: https://unpkg.com/vue@2.1.10/dist/vue.js
2. `npm install vue`
3. Standalone:
   - Development version: https://vuejs.org/js/vue.js
   - Production version: https://vuejs.org/js/vue.min.js

We'll be using the CDN, but in production, you'll probably not want to do that
because CDN wouldn't be entirely reliable.

**Optional**
Get the Vue.js extension for Chrome from the Chrome App Store
